Data Foundations Nanodegree by Bertelsmann & Udacity

## Project 1. Interpret a Data Visualization.

Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself.

## Project 2. Analyze Survey Data.

In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).
Prepare with the descriptive statistics and spreadsheets lessons leading up to the project.

## Project 3. SQL Project.

In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

## Project 4. Build Data Dashboards.

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
